        The diffrence between box shadow and text shadow is that box shadow is used to create a shadow effect around an
        element's box, while text shadow is used to create a shadow effect behind the text itself.
        <br>
        <br>
        The syntax for box shadow is: box-shadow: h-shadow v-shadow blur spread color; where h-shadow is the horizontal
        offset, v-shadow is the vertical offset, blur is the blur radius, spread is the spread radius, and color is the
        color of the shadow.
        <br>
        <br>
        The diffrence between outline and border is that outline does not take up space in the layout, while border
        does. Outline is drawn outside the element's box, while border is drawn inside the element's box.
        <br>
        <br>
        if we want to change the rounded corners of the outline, we can use the border-radius property. However, the
        outline will not have rounded corners unless we also apply the same border-radius to the outline itself.
