        <p>Specificity is a mechanism that determines which CSS rule is applied by the browser when multiple rules could apply to the same element.</p>
        <p>It is calculated based on the types of selectors used in the CSS rule.</p>
        <p>There are four types of selectors, and they are ranked in the following order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inline styles (e.g., <code style="color: red;">style="color: red;"</code>)</li>
            <li>ID selectors (e.g., <code>#id</code>)</li>
            <li>Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes (e.g., <code>.class</code>, <code>[type="text"]</code>, <code>:hover</code>)</li>
            <li>Type selectors and pseudo-elements (e.g., <code>div</code>, <code>::before</code>)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When multiple rules apply to the same element, the browser will apply the rule with the highest specificity.</p>
        <p>For example, if you have a rule that applies to all <code>div</code> elements and another rule that applies to a specific <code>div</code> with an ID of <code>#myDiv</code>, the rule for <code>#myDiv</code> will take precedence.</p>
        <p class="p1">In the case of a tie, the last rule defined in the CSS will be applied.</p>
        <p>Understanding specificity is crucial for writing maintainable and predictable CSS.</p>
        <p>It helps you avoid conflicts and ensures that your styles are applied as intended.</p>
        <p>In summary, specificity is a key concept in CSS that determines which styles are applied to an element based on the selectors used.</p>
